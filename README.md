# Microjava compiler

Implementation of a compiler for Mikrojava which allows translation of syntactically and semantically correct Microcode programs into Mikrojava bytes which can be executed on a Micro Virtual Machine. The given project is carried out in two phases.
1.  The aim of the first phase is to enable parsing syntactically correct and defective programs
2.  Upgrade the first part to be able to do semantic analysis and translate program code for execution

## Structure

Repository is organized as following:
- `doc` directory contains assignment as well as solution document(s)
- `source` directory contains code
